2. *catalog-info.yaml:* Catalog Entities descriptors. See Descriptor Format of Catalog Entities to get started.
lerna.json: Contains information about workspaces and other lerna configuration needed for the monorepo setup.
3. *package.json:* Root package.json for the project. Note: Be sure that you don't add any npm dependencies here as they probably should be installed in the intended workspace rather than in the root.
4. *packages/:* Lerna leaf packages or "workspaces". Everything here is going to be a separate package, managed by lerna.
5. *packages/app/:* An fully functioning Backstage frontend app, that acts as a good starting point for you to get to know Backstage.
6. *packages/backend/:* We include a backend that helps power features such as Authentication, Software Catalog, Software Templates and TechDocs amongst other things.
